# SocialPlanet
The idea of the project is to analyze the effect of location on the network between people from all over the world by targeting the travel history of social media users and their connections. The users would be able to see how the network changes over time, travel patterns of people, possible changes in popularity over time and many more. 

This visualization would be useful for users like social media analysts, influencer agencies, and companies who want to maximize their social media reach.

Our approach involves using the Magic Planet to show the physical location of posts in an intuitive manner. We will encode additional information about posts using color and other visual elements while remaining simple enough to digest quickly. Our data will be scraped from various social media sites ahead of time due to constraints in time to crawl between posts, stripped of non-essential data, and exported to Processing for display on the Magic Planet. The user interface will be a mouse and keyboard to perform rotations, with a stretch goal of swipe controls.
